# Get started

Install:
<ul>
  <li>Python â‰¥ <b>3.12</b>
  <li>Python package <code>beautifulsoup4</code>, installed via <code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code></li>
</ul>


To run <code>music.py</code>, call

```
python music.py ...
```

or, if you set <code>.py</code> files to open with Python by default, simply call

```
music.py ...
```

of, even better, if also you add `.PY` to environment variable PATHEXT (Windows only), call

```
music ...
```

The script takes positional and optional arguments. For help, call the script with option <code>-h</code> like so.

```
music -h
```
